# Readable Project

This is my submission for the Readable project for React & Redux module of the Udacity React nanodegre course. The application allows users to create, edit and delete posts and comments and vote on the posts and comments.


## Installation and usage:
The first step is to clone the repository. We will then run an api server and an application server separately as described below.

#### Api server
In your shell, navigate to the api-server directory, install the project dependencies and start the server:
```sh
$ cd /api-server
$ npm install
$ node server
```

 #### Application server
Open a new shell window, navigate to the applciation server directory, install the project dependencies and start the server:
```sh
$ cd /frontend
$ npm install
$ yarn start
```
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/
